				<li><h4>Have you ever disliked a song at a party?</h4></li>
				<li><h4>Want to make a request for the group, but it's never played?</h4></li>
				<li><h4>Way too often groups can't agree on the right songs to play or the right DJ.</h4></li>

				<h3>MStream is your one way ticket...</h3>
				<p>to getting your requests heard! The application makes music listening more social while enabling everyone to be a part of the selection process for the next song! MStream provides the perfect balance of songs for your party by allowing your guests to collaborate in the song selection process. The beauty of this implementation is that it can work at any event no matter the size, be it a small gathering with friends or a massive rave.</p>

				<h3>How does this all work?</h3>
				<p>MStream uses the Bose SoundTouch API as the core of our music control system to stream the most popular song in the queue from any network device to the speaker. Once connected, users have the ability to vote on songs in the database. Your options are to up vote, down vote or "boo!" a song (if you can't stand another second of a song). This voting system tells MStream exactly what the crowd wants to hear next. If a song receives multiple up votes, it will have a higher priority in the queue, guaranteeing your party will always love the song choice.
